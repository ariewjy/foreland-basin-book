## Welcome {.unnumbered}

This book is adopted from the author pre-thesis, entitled **The Foreland Basin and Its Potential in Hydrocarbon Exploration**. This book will talk about the definition of basin in general, foreland basin in specific, and how it differs compared to other type of basin. A study case from Indonesia's basin will be used as an example of the foreland basin petroleum system.

This book was made to allow people to understand and visualize the foreland basin forming, evolution, and specific implication on petroleum system. This book was created in the spirit of sharing, as the author realized back then the publications on foreland basin are quite rare, and even today the reference that was used in the pre-thesis, is no longer available.

The author hopeful that this website will be useful, not only for people learning about petroleum system, but also people interested in learning about foreland basin.

Special thanks to Budianto Toha as my supervisor for this pre-thesis project, who always encourage me to do more and learn more new things about basin analysis and alike.
